Basic animations using `gganimate` are great for many purposes but you will soon run into issues where your fish tracks are moving across land barriers, especially in more complex environments. This is because the `geom` used in the previous lesson choose the most direct path between two detection points. To avoid this we need to use a specific land avoidance tool. For our next animation we will use the `pathroutr` package which you can find out more about [here](https://jmlondon.github.io/pathroutr/). 

We will begin in much the same way we did for our basic animation lesson with getting our data ready, but things will differ when we start to use `pathroutr` since there are specific data formats expected.


### Preparing our Data 

Just as in the basic animations lesson, we will only look at one fish. We will also filter down the data and only look at **5 detection events** as an example subset due to the computational intensity of `pathroutr` and its calculations.

~~~
library(glatos)
library(sf)
library(gganimate)
library(tidyverse)
library(pathroutr)
library(ggspatial)
library(sp)
library(raster)

detection_events <- #create detections event variable
  read_otn_detections('proj58_matched_detections_2016.csv') %>% # reading detections
  false_detections(tf = 3600) %>%  #find false detections
  filter(passed_filter != FALSE) %>% 
  detection_events(location_col = 'station', time_sep=3600)

plot_data <- detection_events %>% 
  dplyr::select(animal_id, mean_longitude,mean_latitude, first_detection)

one_fish <- plot_data[plot_data$animal_id == "PROJ58-1218518-2015-09-16",]

one_fish <- one_fish %>% filter(mean_latitude < 38.90 & mean_latitude > 38.87) %>% 
  slice(155:160)

### Getting our Shapefile

The first big difference between our basic animation lesson and this lesson is that we will need a shapefile of the study area, so `pathroutr` can determine where the landmasses are located. To do this we will use the `getData` function from the `raster` library which gets geographic data for anywhere in the world. The first argument we will pass to `getData` is the name of the dataset we want to use, for our visualization we will use `GADM`. When you use `GADM` with `getData` you need to provide a `country` argument, which is specified by a country's 3 letter ISO code. In our case we will pass `USA`. Last, we pass an argument for `level`, this is how much we would like the data to be subdivided. Since we are only interested in a portion of the country we will pass `level` the value of `1` which means that the data will be divided by states. When we run this code we will get back a `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame` with the shapefiles for the US states.

~~~
USA<-getData('GADM', country='USA', level=1)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Since we only need one state we will have to filter out the states we don't need. We can do this by filtering the data frame using the same filtering methods we have explored in previous lessons.

~~~
shape_file <- USA[USA$NAME_1 == 'Maryland',]
~~~
{: .language-r}

This shapefile is a great start, but we need the format to be an `sf` `multipolygon`. To do that we will run the `st_as_sf` function on our shapefile. We also want to change the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the file to a projected coordinate system since we will be mapping this plot flat. To do that we will run `st_transform` and provide it the value `5070`.

~~~
md_polygon <- st_as_sf(single_poly) %>% st_transform(5070)
~~~
{: .language-r}

### Formatting our Dataset

We will also need to make some changes to our detection data as well, in order to work with `pathroutr`. To start we will need to turn the path of our fish movements into a `SpatialPoints` format. To do that we will get the `deploy_long` and `deploy_lat` with `dplyr::select` and add them to a variable called `path`. 

Using the `SpatialPoints` function we will pass our new  `path` variable  and `CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs")` for the `proj4string` argument. Just like for our shapefile we will need to turn our path into an `sf` object by using the `st_as_sf` function and change the CRS to a projected coordinate system because we will be mapping it flat.

~~~
path <- one_fish %>%  dplyr::select(mean_longitude,mean_latitude)

path <- SpatialPoints(path, proj4string = CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs"))

path <-  st_as_sf(path)  %>% st_transform(5070)

~~~
{: .language-r}

We can do a quick plot to just check how things look at this stage and see if they are as expected.

~~~
ggplot() + 
  ggspatial::annotation_spatial(md_polygon, fill = "cornsilk3", size = 0) +
  geom_point(data = path, aes(x=unlist(map(geometry,1)), y=unlist(map(geometry,2)))) +
  geom_path(data = path, aes(x=unlist(map(geometry,1)), y=unlist(map(geometry,2))))  +
  theme_void()
~~~
{: .language-r}

### Using `pathroutr`

Now that we have everything we need we can begin to use `pathroutr`. First, we will turn our path points into a `linestring` - this way we can use `st_sample` to sample points on our path.

~~~
plot_path <- path %>% summarise(do_union = FALSE) %>% st_cast('LINESTRING')

track_pts <- st_sample(plot_path, size = 10000, type = "regular")
~~~
{: .language-r}

The first `pathroutr` function we will use is `prt_visgraph`. This creates a visibility graph that connects all of the vertices for our shapefile with a Delaunay triangle mesh and removes any edges that cross land. You could think of this part as creating the viable routes an animal could swim through (marking the "water" as viable).

~~~
vis_graph <- prt_visgraph(md_polygon, buffer = 150)
~~~
{: .language-r}

To reroute our paths around the landmasses we will call the `prt_reroute` function. Passing `track_pts`, `md_polygon`, and `vis_graph` as arguments. To have a fully updated path we can run the `prt_update_points` function, passing our new path `track_pts_fix` with our old path `track_pts`.

~~~
track_pts_fix <- prt_reroute(track_pts, land_barrier, vis_graph, blend = TRUE)

track_pts_fix <- prt_update_points(track_pts_fix, track_pts)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Now with our newly fixed path we can visualize it and see how it looks. We can also use this plot as the base plot for our animation. 

For `geom_point` and `geom_path` we will pass in `track_pts_fix` for the `data` argument, but we will need to get a little creative for the `x` and `y` arguments in the aesthetic. `track_pts_fix` is a list of points so we will need a way to subset just the `x` and `y` values in order to supply them to the aesthetic. We will do this using `map(geometry,1)` to get a list of the values, and then `unlist` to turn that into a vector.

~~~
pathroutrplot <- ggplot() + 
  ggspatial::annotation_spatial(md_polygon, fill = "cornsilk3", size = 0) +
  geom_point(data = track_pts_fix, aes(x=unlist(map(geometry,1)), y=unlist(map(geometry,2)))) +
  geom_path(data = track_pts_fix, aes(x=unlist(map(geometry,1)), y=unlist(map(geometry,2))))  +
  theme_void()

### Animating our New Path

With our plot in good order we are now able to animate! We will follow what we did in the basic animation lesson with updating our `pathroutrplot` variable by using it as the basemap, then adding extra information. Using the function `transition_reveal` and then `shadow_mark`, we will use the arguments of `past` equal to `TRUE` and `future` equal to `FALSE`. Then we are good to call the `gganimate::animate` function and watch our creation!

~~~
pathroutrplot.animation <-
  pathroutrplot +
  transition_reveal(fid) +
  shadow_mark(past = TRUE, future = FALSE)

gganimate::animate(pathroutrplot.animation)
